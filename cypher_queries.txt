Before importing data into Neo4j, we kept only the 3 columns(user_id, age, gender) 
from the soc-pokec-profiles.txt file using python(networks.py). 
Then we converted the files from .txt to .csv and we imported them to neo4j using the following commands:

-Creation of nodes

USING PERIODIC COMMIT
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///profiles.csv" AS row
FIELDTERMINATOR ';'
CREATE (:Profile {userId: toInteger(row.user), age: toInteger(row.age), gender: row.gender})


-Creation of relationships

USING PERIODIC COMMIT
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///relationships.csv" AS row
FIELDTERMINATOR ';'
MATCH (p1:Profile {userId: toInteger(row.user) })
MATCH (p2:Profile {userId: toInteger(row.friend) })
CREATE (p1)-[:FRIENDS_WITH]->(p2);


-Then we created an index in order to increase efficient

CREATE INDEX ON :Profile(userId)


-We ran the following queries. There are screenshots with the results in neo4j folder.


1.For each user, count his/her friends

MATCH (p: Profile)-[:FRIENDS_WITH]->(f: Profile)
RETURN p.userId, count(f.userId) AS friend

2.For each user, count his/her friends of friends

MATCH (p:Profile)-->(friend:Profile)-->(friend_of_friend:Profile)
RETURN p.userId, count(friend_of_friend.userId)

Duration: Started streaming 1421423 records in less than 1 ms and completed after 1485099 ms



3.For each user, count his/her friends that are over 30

MATCH (p: Profile)-[:FRIENDS_WITH]->(f: Profile)
WHERE f.age > 30
RETURN p.userId, count(f.userId) AS friend

Duration: Started streaming 607359 records after 7758 ms and completed after 8161 ms



4.For each male user, count how many male and female friends he is having 

MATCH (p: Profile)-[:FRIENDS_WITH]->(f: Profile)
where p.gender = "1" and f.gender <> "-1"
RETURN p.userId, sum(toInteger(f.gender)) AS male, count(f.userId)-sum(toInteger(f.gender)) AS female
